==========================================

This project is a Playground for Kotlin, MVI, Clean Architecture and other things.

 - This project uses [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) _Data provided by Marvel. Â© 2016 MARVEL_
 - It is highly inspired / reimplementation of [mosby-mvi](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby/tree/master/sample-mvi) sample for now. Will improve in future. MVI on top of MVP
 - Kotlin implementation is inspired from [MVI For Android Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64rQ9GKphTg) by oldergod

### Clean Architecture

Currently divided into three module :
 - api : For API entities
 - data : For logic, Repositories, Uses Cases, Mappers
 - presentation : Views and Presenters
 - cache module (Future): Using Room in future


    ```
    presentation --> data --> api/cache
    ```

Contains two branches
 - [base-project] Without any MVP / MVI, just the backend and clean architecture in kotlin, to be used later
 - [mvi] MVP with MVI implementation
